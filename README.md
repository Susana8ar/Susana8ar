- 👋 Hi, I’m @Susana8ar
- 👀 I’m interested in hydro-meteorology. Specific topics of interest include rainfall monitoring and modelling, urban drainage modelling and management, citizen science for water management, amongst others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and familiarising myself with other data science tools - as I move away from Matlab & VB.
- 💞️ Not sure what I’m looking to collaborate on as yet. I plan to initially work on small personal/professional projects.
